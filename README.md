# TextAnalysis_Reviews
#
Each Jupyter notebook has a separate analysis. All reviews is the analysis of the all the reviews provided and equal rating is the analysis of 1,000 reviews split evenly into half positive and half negative reviews. The other 5 notebooks are for each of the groups of companies. There are associated csv files for each of the analyses. 

I also had some encoding issues, so if the the file doesn't read properly, switching to utf-8 or latin-1 should do the trick.
